# US Flight Delay Prediction Using Big Data and PySpark

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting flight delays within the United States for the year 2018. Utilizing the [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data from 2009 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018), we employ PySpark to handle large datasets and implement various machine learning techniques to gain insights and make predictions.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the analysis:

1. **Data Integration**: Combines data from multiple sources and performs initial cleaning to prepare for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigates the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
3. **Geographical Visualization**: Maps flight routes and delays to provide spatial insights.
4. **Classification**: Applies classification algorithms to predict whether a flight will be delayed.
5. **Clustering**: Groups flights based on similarities to identify common characteristics of delayed flights.
6. **Regression**: Utilizes regression models to predict the extent of delays in minutes.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used in this project is the [Airline Delay and Cancellation Data from 2009 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018), which includes comprehensive records of flight delays and cancellations across the United States. For this analysis, we focus exclusively on data from the year 2018.

## Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: For distributed data processing and analysis.
- **Python**: For scripting and implementing machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive code development and documentation.

## Getting Started
